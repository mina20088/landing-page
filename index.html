          <p>Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa.[21] He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's University.[16] He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School[22] and a bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Arts and Sciences.[23] He moved to California in 1995 to begin a Ph.D. in applied physics and material sciences at Stanford University, but decided to pursue a business career instead of enrolling.[24] He co-founded (with his brother Kimbal) Zip2, a web software company, which was acquired by Compaq for $340 million in 1999. Musk then founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with Confinity in 2000, which had launched PayPal the previous year and was subsequently bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October 2002.[10][25][26]</p>

          <p>In May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. He joined Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.), an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded,[10] became its product architect, and became its CEO in October 2008.[27] In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company (now a subsidiary of Tesla). In 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that aims to promote friendly artificial intelligence. In July 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces. In December 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company, an infrastructure and tunnel construction company focused on tunnels optimized for electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>In addition to his primary business pursuits, Musk has envisioned a high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop. Musk has said the goals of SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity revolve around his vision to "change the world and help humanity".[28] His goals include reducing global warming through sustainable energy production and consumption, and lessening the risk of human extinction by establishing a human colony on Mars.[29][30][31],Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa.[21][32] His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada,[33][34][35] and who was raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant and property developer.[36] He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[40][35]</p>

          <p>While awaiting Canadian documentation, Musk attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[58] Once in Canada, Musk entered Queen's University in 1989, avoiding mandatory service in the South African military.[59] He left in 1992 to study economics and physics at the University of Pennsylvania; he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from Wharton and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics from the College of Arts and Sciences.[60][61][62]</p>

Kids these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works, but he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out."[47]:60</p>

          <h5>Tesla</h5>
          <p>Tesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors) was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[124] Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Elon Musk's involvement.[125] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as its chairman.[126][127][25][128] According to Musk, all three, along with J. B. Straubel, were inspired by the earlier AC Propulsion tzero electric roadster prototype.[129] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[130][failed verification][non-primary source needed] Following the financial crisis in 2008 and after a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[95][131] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008, positions he still holds today. As of 2019, Elon Musk is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[20]</p>

          <h5>SpaceX</h5>
          <p>In 2001, Musk conceived Mars Oasis, an idea to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars, containing food crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt to reawaken public interest in space exploration.[77][78] In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished Dnepr Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the envisioned payloads into space. The group met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers.[79] The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin. Griffin had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel, as well as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and was just leaving Orbital Sciences, a maker of satellites and spacecraft</p>
